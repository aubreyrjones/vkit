# vkit

vkit is a clean, lightweight, modern OpenGL UI toolkit written in C++11. 

Originally based on [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui), vkit has minimal dependencies: it requires
[GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg), and
[GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw). Extra functionality is available if you also provide
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), but it isn't required for most widgets.
